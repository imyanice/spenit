# spenit: a smol and simple spending tracker

hey! spenit is my first swift project EVER! kinda proud of it and how it looks :D (even if it's kinda raw)
i created this app for a "very" specific use case: to track expenses i do with cash or card (account type), you can even add more such as crypto wallet, amex etc!

to use it, you need to build it with xcode and select your iphone as the destination to get it on your phone for a duration of 7 days, then you'll just have to build it again!

the license is gplv3.0 :)
